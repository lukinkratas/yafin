As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others.  Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. Given the strategy's focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead.",

            "reportTitle": "The stock market turned the corner following Thursday's rather large downside reversal, which just happened to coincide with the short-term disappointment over Nvidia's quarterly report. The S&P 500 closed at $6,539 on November 20, just points below its prior low from October 10. Since then, the entire market reversed higher -- and this time, stocks were not led by Information Technology, but rather by diverse sector and industry strength. While IT and semiconductors have bounced, some of the largest losers on Tuesday were AMD, NVDA, SMCI, VST, and NFLX (which all fell between 2.4% and 4.2%). The IT sector was near the bottom, with a 0.3% gain, with only Energy (XLE -0.6%) and (XLU -0.4%) worse off.   As we have talked about in recent commentaries, Healthcare (XLV) led once again on Tuesday, with a 2.3% pop, followed by Discretionary (XLY +2.1%); Materials (XLB +1.5%); Staples (XLP + 1.4%); Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF), both rising 1.3%; Communication Services (XLC +1.1%); and Real Estate (XLRE +0.8%). So there was strength in many different sectors and industries, and rotation remains in gear as money flows from area to area but never moves to the sidelines.     The S&P 500 reclaimed its 21-day exponential and 50-day simple averages, but ran right into the key 61.8% retracement of the recent decline. In addition, price ran right to prior support off the lows since late July -- which is now resistance in the 6,770 area. A pop over this region will likely put an end to the multi-month sloppy action and open the doors for new all-time highs during the last month of 2025. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)",

            "reportTitle": "For the second time this week, stocks were hit with consistent selling pressure as November is off to a rocky start. Technology, and more specifically, semiconductor and software stocks, led the downside once again. Weakness from the largest semi and software companies was evident, with NVDA off 3.7%, AVGO 1%, TSM 1.5%, AMD over 7%, MSFT 2%, ORCL 2.6%, PLTR almost 7%, and CRM 5%.   It wasn't just the mega caps that were hit, with former leaders, some of which reported Q3 EPS, wrecked -- including ELF (-35%), DUOL (-25%), DASH (-17%), HOOD (-11%), and AXON, which fell 8% after Wednesday's 9% slide. OUCH!  The S&P 500 fell 1.1%, falling below its 21-day exponential average (EMA) and with a minor 5-day/13-day EMA bearish crossover. Key support from the rising 50-day lies at 6,666, with chart support at 6,550 (from the recent low on October 10). The Nasdaq and the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) lost 1.9% and both broke their 21-day EMAs. The 50-day for the QQQ is at 601 with chart support at 589.     Buying the dip (BTD) has taken on a different meaning since the April bottom. Dips were once considered multiple-week affairs, with the S&P 500 dropping 5% to 10%. The index has seen a daily drop of more than 1% nine times since April 7. Incredibly, it has rebounded the next day every signal time, with five of those occasions wiping out the loss from the previous day. One way to spot a potential trend change is to look for a technical clue known as a change in character. If the current very rapid BTD stops, that would be a change in character.

As such, the following is a two-tiered list of companies in Argus' fundamental Universe of Coverage and highlight stocks that are seeing the highest gains from their 52-week lows. We used our Argus screener to find large caps above $250 billion in market cap, and then sorted by sector. We also note our rating and the percentage gains in these stocks. The first list includes non-tech companies, while the second includes the tech companies. Some in this list are technically not categorized as IT companies, but we moved them into this group as IT is their main function.",
