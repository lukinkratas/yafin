It tells major financial institutions the average interest rate the Bank of Canada wants to see in the marketplace where they lend each other money for one day, or \"overnight.\" When the Bank changes the Overnight Rate Target, this change usually affects other interest rates, including mortgage rates and prime rates charged by commercial banks. When the Bank changes the Overnight Rate Target, this sends a clear signal about the direction in which it wants short-term interest rates to go. These changes usually lead to moves in the prime rate at commercial banks, which serves as a benchmark for many of their loans. These changes can also indirectly affect mortgage rates, and the interest paid to consumers on bank accounts, GICs, and other savings. "

Consumer perceptions of the following four categories are surveyed: overall livelihood, income growth, employment, and willingness to buy durable goods. Respondents are asked to evaluate on a scale of one to five what they consider the prospects to be for the five subjects over the next six months. Points are then allotted in accordance with the one-to-five scale for each category based on the anticipated effects on consumption. The consumer perception index is calculated by computing the weighted average of the points of the results (component ratio). The consumer confidence index (original figure) is then calculated by simply averaging the four consumer perception indexes (original figures). "
