# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing comprehensive unit tests for the Yahoo Finance API client. The client consists of an AsyncClient class that handles direct API communication and a Stonk class that provides ticker-specific convenience methods. The testing framework should ensure reliability, maintainability, and proper error handling across all components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for the AsyncClient class, so that I can ensure all API endpoints work correctly and handle errors appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing AsyncClient methods THEN the system SHALL mock HTTP requests to avoid external dependencies
2. WHEN testing successful API responses THEN the system SHALL verify correct data parsing and return values
3. WHEN testing API error responses THEN the system SHALL verify proper error handling and exception raising
4. WHEN testing parameter validation THEN the system SHALL verify invalid parameters raise appropriate errors
5. WHEN testing the crumb property THEN the system SHALL verify it fetches and caches authentication tokens correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for the Stonk class, so that I can ensure ticker-specific operations work correctly and delegate properly to the AsyncClient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing Stonk methods THEN the system SHALL verify proper delegation to AsyncClient methods
2. WHEN testing Stonk initialization THEN the system SHALL verify ticker assignment and client instantiation
3. WHEN testing quote summary methods THEN the system SHALL verify correct module extraction from responses
4. WHEN testing financial statement methods THEN the system SHALL verify frequency and type validation
5. WHEN testing balance sheet methods THEN the system SHALL verify trailing frequency is rejected appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unit tests for utility functions, so that I can ensure error handling and URL formatting work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the error function THEN the system SHALL verify proper logging and exception raising
2. WHEN testing print_url function THEN the system SHALL verify correct URL formatting with and without parameters
3. WHEN testing with different exception types THEN the system SHALL verify correct exception class usage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper test fixtures and mocking setup, so that tests run reliably without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL mock all HTTP requests using appropriate testing libraries
2. WHEN testing async methods THEN the system SHALL use proper async test frameworks and fixtures
3. WHEN testing error conditions THEN the system SHALL mock various HTTP error scenarios
4. WHEN testing API responses THEN the system SHALL use realistic mock data that matches Yahoo Finance API structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test coverage reporting, so that I can ensure all code paths are tested adequately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL generate coverage reports showing tested code percentage
2. WHEN coverage is below acceptable threshold THEN the system SHALL fail the test run
3. WHEN viewing coverage reports THEN the system SHALL identify untested code lines and branches
4. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL ensure high coverage of error handling paths

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with the existing project structure, so that tests can be run easily within the current development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding test dependencies THEN the system SHALL update pyproject.toml with testing libraries
2. WHEN organizing test files THEN the system SHALL follow Python testing conventions with proper structure
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing linting and formatting tools
4. WHEN executing tests THEN the system SHALL provide clear output and failure reporting
